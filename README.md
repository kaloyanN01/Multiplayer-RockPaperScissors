# Multiplayer-RockPaperScissors

The game is created with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and for the multiplayer part Socket.io was used to make the connection between players.

Currently the game has only one room where two players can play the game. The player count is capped at 2, so when a third client is opened the first one is kicked, the second becomes the first, and the third becomes the second. Adding more rooms for players to enjoy the game and more elegant solution for the number of players in a room is something that I wish to add in future iterations of the project.
